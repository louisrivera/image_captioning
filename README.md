# Image Based Sales Captioning


## Overview
This repository contains a image captioning/description net that can be used to automatically create simple descriptions for furniture.

## Motivation

Many large companies are exploring Augmented Reality ‘AR’ as it becomes mainstream. Walmart in particular is considering using this technology to enhance their home furnishings business. One goal is to take a photo from a room in a customer’s house and use AR to make recommendations for furniture they should add or swap out. Below is an example of the goal of this project.
